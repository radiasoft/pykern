"""PKDict abstraction and utils

`PKDict` is similar to :class:`argparse.Namespace`, but is a dict that allows
you to treat elements as attributes.

class PKDict(dict):
    """A subclass of dict that allows items to be read/written as attributes.

    The purpose of this is as a convenience in coding. You
    can refer to dictionary keys as attributes as long as they
    don't collide with the object's attributes. You should always
    use the `dict` interface to refer to the items of the dictionary
    programmatically, just like you would do with Javascript.

    You can reference any dict key as an attribute as long as it
    does not conflict with an attribute. For example, this works::

        x = PKDict()
        x.a = 1
        assert 1 == x.a
        x['a'] = 3
        assert 3 == x.a
        assert 'a' == x.keys()[0]

    You can't set an attribute that already exists. These calls throw
    exceptions::

        x.values = 1
        delattr(x, 'values')

    `dict` doesn't allow this anyway. However, you can't set or
    delete any existing attribute, even writable attributes. Indeed,
    you can't delete attributes at all. Subclasses should be "containers"
    only, not general objects.
